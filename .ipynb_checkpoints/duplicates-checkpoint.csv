""The inhibitory activity of 4 towards human intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) was greatly decreased (IC50 >172.0μM) compared to 2 (IC50 =0.81μM).""

However, the actual experimental assay used to measure IC50 values is described in the following passage:

""In vitro CYP3A4 inhibition assay: The compounds 2 and 4 (8 μg–0.8 ng) were applied to Vivid CYP3A4 screening kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and IC50 (50% inhibition of the enzyme activity) values of the compounds were calculated as described in Ref.26. All experiments in this study were conducted with three replicates.""

The assay used is a commercial kit called Vivid CYP3A4 screening kit, which is used to measure the inhibitory activity of compounds against CYP3A4. The IC50 values are calculated based on the amount of compound required to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity.

As for the quality of the results produced by the assay, I would give a confidence score of 0.8 out of 1. This is because the assay is a commercial kit, which is widely used and validated, but the specific details of the assay protocol are not described in the paper. Additionally, the IC50 values are reported as a single value for each compound, without any information on the variability or reproducibility of the results. However, the use of a commercial kit and the fact that the experiments were conducted with three replicates suggest that the results are likely to be reliable.",-0.09151498112135023

SCY-635 inhibited the peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity of cyclophilin A at nanomolar concentrations but showed no detectable inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase activity at concentrations up to 2 microM. Metabolic studies indicated that SCY-635 did not induce the major cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2, 2B6, and 3A4. SCY-635 was a weak inhibitor and a poor substrate for P-glycoprotein. Functional assays with stimulated Jurkat cells and stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated that SCY-635 is a weaker inhibitor of interleukin-2 secretion than cyclosporine. A series of two-drug combination studies was performed in vitro. SCY-635 exhibited synergistic antiviral activity with alpha interferon 2b and additive antiviral activity with ribavirin. SCY-635 was shown to be orally bioavailable in multiple animal species and produced blood and liver concentrations of parent drug that exceeded the 50% effective dose determined in the bicistronic con1b-derived replicon assay.

The paper describes the enzymatic potency of the BTK inhibitors using a BTK enzyme assay, where the IC50 values are reported for several compounds, including molecule 16, which is the top molecule described in the paper. The IC50 value for molecule 16 is reported as 0.7 nM.

As 17alpha-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase (CYP17) catalyzes the last step in androgen biosynthesis, inhibition of this target should affect not only testicular but also adrenal androgen formation. Therefore CYP17 inhibitors should be advantageous over existing therapies, for example with GnRH analogues. However, steroidal drugs are known for side effects which are due to affinities for steroid receptors. Therefore we decided to synthesize non-steroidal compounds mimicking the natural CYP17 substrates pregnenolone and progesterone. The synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of 15 novel and highly active non-steroidal CYP17 inhibitors are reported. The compounds were prepared via Suzuki-cross-coupling, Grignard reaction and CDI-assisted S(N)t-reaction with imidazole and their inhibitory activity was examined with recombinant human CYP17 expressed in Escherichia coli. Promising compounds were further tested for their selectivity against the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4 and the glucocorticoid-forming enzyme CYP11B1. All compounds turned out to be potent CYP17 inhibitors.

Unfortunately, the pharmacokinetic properties of E-37P decrease its effectiveness when tested in vivo. To improve the bioavailability and increase the efficiency of aminosteroid E-37P, two series of analog compounds were synthesised by classic chemical synthesis, they were then characterized, and the concentration that inhibits 50% of cell proliferation (IC50) was determined on different cell lines. RM-133, a 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol derivative with a quinoline nucleus at the end of the piperazine-proline side-chain at position 2β and an ethinyl at position 17α, showed very good antiproliferative activity among the five cancer cell lines studied (IC50=0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 2.0 and 1.1 μM for HL-60, MCF-7, T-47D, LNCaP and WEHI-3, respectively). Moreover, the plasmatic concentration of RM-133 at 3h, when injected subcutaneously in rats, was 2.3-fold higher than that of E-37P (151 vs 64.8 ng/mL). Furthermore, RM-133 weakly inhibited the two representative liver enzymes, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, indicating a very low risk of drug-drug interactions. The cytotoxicity of RM-133 against normal cells was tested on peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) obtained from different donors and previously activated with phytohemagglutinin-L. PBL responded differently to treatment with RM-133, we observed a stimulation of cell proliferation and/or cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner.

Briefly, test articles were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 5 M midazolam, 0.1 mg/mL pooled human liver microsomes, and 1 mM NADPH for 5 min. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of quench solution (H2O/acetonitrile/formic-acid = 94:5:1) containing 13C-1-hydroxymidazolam (0.1 M final) as the internal standard. In order to test time-dependency of CYP3A4 inhibition, an identical reaction was started without midazolam and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min. After the pre-incubation, 5 M midazolam was added and incubated for 5 min before the quench solution was added. The samples were centrifuged at 1500 RPM for 15 min to precipitate denatured microsomal proteins.

P-gp inhibition studies indicate that donepezil exhibits better inhibition relative to CYP3A4 (P-gp EC50=34.85±4.63μM) although it was less potent compared to ketoconazole (P-gp EC50=9.74±1.23μM). At higher concentrations, donepezil exhibited significant inhibition of CYP3A4 (69%, 84% and 87% inhibition at 100, 250 and 500μM, respectively). This indicates its potential to cause drug-drug interactions with other CYP3A4 substrates upon co-administration; however, this scenario is unlikely in vivo due to the low therapeutic concentrations of donepezil. Similarly, donepezil co-administration with P-gp substrates or inhibitors is unlikely to result in beneficial or adverse drug interactions. The molecular docking studies show that the 5,6-dimethoxyindan-1-one moiety of donepezil was oriented closer to the heme center in CYP3A4 whereas in the P-gp binding site, the protonated benzylpiperidine pharmacophore of donepezil played a major role in its binding ability. Energy parameters indicate that donepezil complex with both CYP3A4 and P-gp was less stable (CDOCKER energies=-15.05 and -4.91kcal/mol, respectively) compared to the ketoconazole-CYP3A4 and P-gp complex (CDOCKER energies=-41.89 and -20.03kcal/mol, respectively).","The experimental assay used to measure IC50 activity values against the target Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is described in the following passage:

""The Vivid CYP3A4 assay principle (Life Technologies, Burlington, Canada, catalogue number P2857) is based on the conversion of a substrate into a highly fluorescent chromophore by human CYP3A4 enzyme measured as relative fluorescence units (RFUs). Donepezil (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) solutions were prepared in methanol (MeOH, maximum concentration of 5% in final wells) then diluted with phosphate buffer pH 8.0 to obtain desired concentrations (final concentrations: 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 250 and 500 μM). The assay includes a solution of microsomes prepared from insect cells expressing recombinant human CYP3A4 enzyme, human CYP450 reductase in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and a glucose-6-phosphate/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase system that converts NADP+ into NADPH to initiate the CYP450 reaction. Each well contains 40 μL of test compound and 50 μL of CYP3A4/CYP450 reductase and was incubated for 10 min. at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μL of the substrate/NADP+ mixture to each well and the fluorescence was measured every min. for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 0.5 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane solution pH 10.8. RFUs were measured in a black, clear-bottom 96-well plate using SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. The assay protocol was validated by running a standard curve using the supplied fluorescence substrate at various concentrations (0, 7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 nM). Appropriate controls including the known CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were employed and the inhibition for each compound was calculated as half maximal",-0.6989700043360187

The imidazole-bearing antifungals more effectively reduced trailing growth associated with persistence and/or recurrence of fungal infections than triazole-based derivatives. The imidazole derivatives were more toxic to mammalian cells and more potently inhibited the activity of CYP3A4, which is one of the main causes of azole toxicity.

Among these, ethyl-substituted 3 possesses high selectivity against CYP1A2.

Moreover, pyrroloquinolinone 4 exhibits no inhibition of the six most important hepatic CYP enzymes as well as a bioavailability in the range of the marketed drug fadrozole.

2.3.3 Influence on recombinant human CYP3A4 P450 cytochrome

The cytochromes P450 (CYPs) inhibition, as a source of potential DDI, has become an important concern for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and pharmaceutical companies. DDI occurs if one drug affects the activity of CYPs and the other, co-administrated drug (victim), is excluded from metabolism, thus increasing the toxic concentration.37   The FDA’s draft guidance document for DDI recommends evaluating the CYPs’ inhibition potential of new biologically active compounds at an earlier stage in drug development to avoid developing molecules with the potential to yield adverse drug interactions.41   During this study, the luminescence assay was used to evaluate the potential inhibition or induction of cytochrome CYP3A4 by compound 8 . This assay is based on the conversion of the beetle d -luciferin derivative into d -luciferin by recombinant human isoenzyme CYP3A4. After addition of the firefly luciferase, the measured amount of light produced was proportional to obtained d -luciferin concentration in the presence of compound 8 .42   The comparison with the luminescence obtained in the control reaction allowed evaluating the effect of compound 8  on CYP3A4 activity. Previous experiments showed that CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole inhibited completely the CYP3A4 activity at 10 μM with calculated IC50  = 0.14 μM.43   As shown in Fig. 6  , compound 8  did not change the CYP3A4 activity, even at a very high concentration of 25 μM.

The confidence score for the quality of results produced by this assay is 0.8. The assay is a well-established method for evaluating the inhibition of CYP3A4, and the use of a luminescence assay provides a sensitive and quantitative measure of enzyme activity. However, the use of a single concentration of 25 μM for compound 8  may not provide a complete picture of its potential inhibitory effects on CYP3A4, and further studies at lower concentrations may be necessary to fully evaluate its potential for drug-drug interactions.",-0.8538719643217619

This passage describes the CYP3A4 inhibition assay used to evaluate the potential of the H3 R ligands to inhibit CYP3A4 activity. The assay uses a luminescent CYP3A4 P450-Glo assay and protocol provided by Promega, and the final concentrations of the H3 R ligands tested ranged from 0.01 μM to 25 μM.

The confidence score for the quality of results produced by this assay is 0.8. This is because the assay is a well-established and widely used method for evaluating CYP3A4 inhibition, and the use of a luminescent assay provides a sensitive and quantitative measure of enzyme activity. However, the assay may not be as sensitive to subtle changes in enzyme activity, and the use of a single concentration range (0.01 μM to 25 μM) may not capture the full range of inhibitory activity of the H3 R ligands.

The IC50 values for the H3 R ligands against CYP3A4 are not explicitly stated in the passage, but the results are described as showing ""weak inhibition activity, reaching around 50% of CYP3A4 activity only at the highest used concentration of 25 μM.""

Therefore, it is meaningful to develop highly selective CYP inhibitors.

Three series of the 4th generation 2-fluoro 9-oxime erythromycin ketolides were synthesized and evaluated. Incorporation of substituted heteroaryl groups (a - m), in contrast to previously reported the unsubstituted heteroaryl groups, proved to the beneficial for enhancement of the activities of the 9-propgargyl ketolide 8 series and the 9-allyl ketolide 14 series. But these aryl groups (a - m) cannot supply the resulting compounds 8 and 14, unlike corresponding the 6-allyl ketolide 20 series, with activity against constitutively resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, hybrids of macrolides and quinolones (8, 14 and 20, Ar = n - t) exhibited not only high activities against susceptible, inducibly erm-mediated resistant, and efflux-mediated resistant strains, but also significantly improved potencies against constitutively resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. The capacity was highlighted by introduction of newly designed carbamoyl quinolones (q, r, s and t) rather than commonly seen carboxy quinolones (o and p) as the pharmacophores. Structure-activity relationships and molecular modelling indicated that 8r, 14r and 20q may have different binding sites compared to current erythromycins. Moreover, 8r, 14r and 20q have 2.5-3.6 times prolonged half-life and 2.3- to 2.6-fold longer mean residence time in vivo over telithromycin. These findings pave the way for rational design of novel non-telithromycin macrolides that target new binding sites within bacterial ribosomes.","The paper describes the synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2-fluoro 9-oxime ketolides, a new class of macrolide antibiotics. The authors designed and synthesized 36 compounds with different heteroaryl groups attached to the 9-oxime ether ketolides. They tested the antibacterial activity of these compounds against a panel of erythromycin-susceptible and clinical erythromycin-resistant isolates.

The paper reports that most of the compounds in the 8, 9, and 14 series are highly active against susceptible bacteria and various inducibly erm- or mef-mediated resistant pathogens. However, the compounds in the 20 series are highly potent against constitutively resistant S. pneumoniae. The authors also found that the 20 series has a different binding site compared to the 8 and 14 series.

The authors used molecular docking to model the binding of the compounds to the ribosome and found that the 20 series has a different binding site compared to the 8 and 14 series. They also found that the 20 series has a longer half-life and a longer mean residence time in vivo compared to telithromycin.

The authors conclude that the 20 series is a promising new class of macrolide antibiotics with improved activity against constitutively resistant S. pneumoniae. They also suggest that the 20 series may have a different mechanism of action compared to the 8 and 14 series.

The quality of the results produced by the assay is high, as the authors used a variety of techniques, including molecular docking and in vitro and in vivo experiments, to evaluate the activity of the compounds. The results are also well-supported by the data, with clear and concise descriptions of the methods and results.

However, the paper has some limitations. The authors did not test the compounds against a wide range of bacterial strains, and the in vivo experiments were limited to a small number of animals. Additionally, the authors did not provide a clear explanation of the mechanism of action of the 20 series.

Overall, the paper provides valuable information on the synthesis and antibacterial activity of 2-fluoro 9-oxime ketolides and suggests that the 20 series is a promising new class of macrolide antibiotics. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism of action and potential applications of these compounds.

Recent research suggests that there may be a causal link between this condition and abnormal glucocorticoid processing. Specifically, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis leads to increased systemic cortisol concentrations. Cushing' syndrome, a disorder that is also typified by a marked elevation in levels of cortisol, produces clinical symptomology that is similar to those observed in MetS, and they can be alleviated by decreasing circulating cortisol concentrations. As a result, it has been suggested that decreasing systemic cortisol concentration might have a positive impact on the progression of MetS. This could be accomplished through inhibition of enzymes in the cortisol synthetic pathway, 11β-hydroxylase (Cyp11B1), 17α-hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase (Cyp17), and 21-hydroxylase (Cyp21).

In addition, differences in the SAR patterns of Cyp17 and Cyp3A4 enabled the identification of compounds with a higher degree of selectivity as compared to the parent compound (4). Installation of a methyl sulfonamide (6a), for example, produced a 3-fold increase in Cyp17 potency, while Cyp3A4 activity remained nearly unchanged. These differences produce a net effect of increasing Cyp17 selectivity from 3-fold to >10-fold. Extending the sulfonamide by one additional carbon atom (6b) led to an additional >20-fold increase in Cyp17 potency (0.73 nM) and once again Cyp3A4 activity remained nearly unchanged (162 nM), leading to a 222-fold selectivity factor.""

However, the assay used to measure aromatase activity is described in Section 4.6 of the paper, which is a modified titrated water assay.

The assay is used to measure the activity of aromatase in JEG-3 cells, which are known to have high aromatase activity. The assay involves treating the cells with androst-4-ene-3,17-dione[1β-3 H] as the aromatase substrate, and measuring the concentration of product formed per mg of protein per hour in the absence and presence of inhibitors.

To measure the IC50 values, the authors used a concentration range of 0.001 pM to 100 pM for the inhibitors. The IC50 value is the concentration of inhibitor required to inhibit 50% of the aromatase activity.

The confidence score for the quality of results produced by this assay is 0.8, as it is a well-established and widely used method for measuring aromatase activity, and the results are likely to be reliable and accurate.

However, it is worth noting that the IC50 values mentioned in the paper are for aromatase activity, not CYP3A4 activity. The IC50 values for CYP3A4 activity are mentioned in Table 4, which lists the IC50 values for a panel of CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4. The IC50 values for CYP3A4 are as follows:

* 13e: 5.3 ± 0.33 μM
* 13h: 2.88 ± 0.16 μM

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are heme-thiolate proteins that are responsible for the oxidative metabolism of a wide variety of drugs. Inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes is one of the most common mechanisms leading to drug-drug interactions (DDI).23   Many azole antifungal agents have great inhibitory effects of CYP enzymes.

The quality of the results produced by this assay is high, with a confidence score of 0.9. The assay was performed using a standard protocol, and the results were analyzed using a well-established method (LC/MS/MS). The IC50 values were reported as a specific concentration (μM) that inhibited the enzyme activity by 50%, which is a standard way to express the potency of an inhibitor. The use of a panel of five CYP isoforms and a specific substrate for each isoform ensures that the assay is comprehensive and reliable.

However, there are a few potential limitations to consider:

1. The assay was performed in human liver microsomes, which may not perfectly reflect the in vivo situation.
2. The IC50 values were determined using a single concentration of the test compound, which may not capture the full range of inhibitory activity.

The passage describing the experimental assay used to measure IC50 activity values against the target Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is found in section 4.4 of the paper, titled ""In vitro evaluation of interaction with cytochrome P450"". This section describes the use of a luminescence assay based on the conversion of luciferin derivatives into D-luciferin by recombinant CYPs to evaluate the influence of compound 17 on cytochrome P450 isoforms activity.

The confidence score for the quality of results produced by the assay is 0.8 out of 1. The assay is well described, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner. However, the paper does not provide information on the specificity and sensitivity of the assay, which would be useful for evaluating the quality of the results.

Here is the relevant passage:

4.4 In vitro evaluation of interaction with cytochrome P450

The evaluation of the influence of tested compound 17 on cytochrome P450 isoforms activity was performed using luminescence assay basing on the conversion of luciferin derivatives into D-luciferin by recombinant CYPs. The luminescent CYP3A4 P450-GloTM and CYP2D6 P450-GloTM assays and protocols were provided by Promega (Madison, WI, USA) (Cali JJ, Ma D, Sobol M et al. Luminogenic cytochrome P450 assays. Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2006; 2:629–645). The reference drugs ketoconazole and quinidine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). The enzymatic reactions were performed in white polystyrene, flat-bottom NuncTM MicroWellTM 96-",-1.0

Novel 14-membered non-ketolides possessing long spacers beyond three-atom length were evaluated for antibacterial activity. The most potent one is 34a, featuring a five-atom-length flexible linker from of a pyridine ring to the aglycone. Conversion of the pyridine of 34a to other aryl groups, changing the linker's length of 34a to longer or shorter ones, and variation of the linker flexibility to a rigid olefin or alkyne led to decreased antibacterial activity. The hybrids of macrolides and quinolones 28b, 31 and 34b possessing various sidechains, unlike their 15-membered counterparts, were ineffective compared to 34a. Similar to the marketed ketolide telithromycin, the non-ketolide 34a proved to be a time-dependent bactericidal agent, but it exhibited superior in vivo pharmacokinetic properties such as longer half-life, higher plasma concentration, lower clearance and shorter time to reach the highest drug concentration relative to telithromycin. Molecular docking suggested 34a might π - π interact with the bacterial ribosomal RNA base G2505Ec. This study suggested that the bacteriostatic agent erythromycin can be structurally modified to afford a new bactericidal chemotype that targets the ribosome and is superior to ciprofloxacin with regard to its minimum bactericidal concentration.","The paper describes the synthesis and structure-activity relationships of non-ketolides, a new class of antibiotics that are derived from erythromycin. The authors designed and synthesized a series of non-ketolides with varying linker chain lengths and rigidities, and tested their antibacterial activity against a panel of erythromycin-resistant and erythromycin-susceptible clinical isolates and ATCC strains.

The results showed that the most potent non-ketolide, 34a, featured a 5-atom-length flexible linker anchored with a pyridyl group, and exhibited superior bactericidal activity against inducibly resistant S. aureus PU32, susceptible S. pneumoniae ATCC49619, and efflux-resistant S. pneumoniae PU09. The authors also found that the bactericidal activity of 34a was comparable to that of telithromycin, a marketed ketolide antibiotic.

The authors used molecular modeling to investigate the binding mode of 34a to the bacterial ribosome, and found that it interacted with the bacterial ribosomal base G2484Dr (G2505Ec) via π-π stacking. They also tested the in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of 34a in male SD rats via oral administration and found that it exhibited superior PK properties compared to telithromycin.

However, the authors noted that 34a was a medium inhibitor of human liver CYP 3A4, which could lead to drug-drug interactions.

The authors concluded that the study demonstrated the potential of non-ketolides as a new class of antibiotics with improved bactericidal activity against resistant pathogens, and that further structural modification of 34a could lead to safer and more effective non-ketolide candidates.

To answer your question, the quality of the results produced by the assay is high, with a confidence score of 0.9. The study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the antibacterial activity of non-ketolides, and the results are well-supported by molecular modeling and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies.

The quality of the results is high because:

* The study uses a well-established and validated method for evaluating antibacterial activity (MIC and MBC assays)
* The authors use a diverse panel of bacterial strains, including resistant and susceptible isolates
* The study includes molecular modeling and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies to support the results
* The authors provide a clear and concise description of the synthesis and characterization of the non-ketolides

This table presents the IC50 values for various HIV protease inhibitors against CYP3A4, which is the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, including HIV protease inhibitors. The IC50 values are measured in μM (micromolar) and represent the concentration of the inhibitor required to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity.

The passage that describes the experimental assay used to measure IC50 activity values against the target HIV-1 protease is:

""The compounds were tested for the ability to inhibit HIV-1 protease. The enzymes employed were derived from both the wild-type (NL4-3) virus and from a panel of clinical viral isolates from patients infected with highly PI-resistant strains of HIV-1 (K-60, Q-60, and V-18). The HIV-1 strains employed were those that we have observed to exhibit the highest resistance to indinavir, and the genotype and phenotype of these strains have been reported.5,9 The compounds were also tested for the ability to inhibit the spread of viral infection in MT4 human T-lymphoid cells in culture using viral constructs derived from the strains described above.""

However, there is a description of an assay used to measure the inhibition of CYP3A4 enzyme activity, which is presented in Table 2.

The assay used to measure CYP3A4 inhibition is based on the measurement of the metabolic stability of the compounds in human liver microsomes. The metabolic stability is measured as the clearance of the compound (CLint) in human liver microsomes. The results are presented in Table 2, which shows the IC50 values for CYP3A4 inhibition for each compound.

The quality of the results produced by this assay is high, as it is a well-established method for measuring CYP3A4 inhibition. However, the description of the assay is brief and does not provide detailed information on the experimental conditions, such as the concentration of the enzyme, the substrate used, and the duration of the incubation. Therefore, I would assign a confidence score of 0.8 out of 1.0 for the quality of the results produced by this assay.

Following high-throughput screening and subsequent structure-based optimization, we identified BAY-805 to be a non-covalent inhibitor with low nanomolar affinity for USP21 and high selectivity over other DUB targets as well as kinases, proteases, and other common off-targets. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA) demonstrated high-affinity target engagement of BAY-805, resulting in strong NF-κB activation in a cell-based reporter assay.

Itraconazole and posaconazole are clinically useful triazole anti-fungals that are being repurposed as anti-cancer agents based on their ability to inhibit the Hh pathway. We have previously demonstrated that removal of the triazole from itraconazole does not affect its ability to inhibit the Hh pathway while abolishing its primary side effect, potent inhibition of Cyp3A4. To develop structure-activity relationships for the related posaconazole scaffold, we synthesized and evaluated a series of des-triazole analogues designed through both ligand- and structure-based methods. These compounds demonstrated improved anti-Hh properties compared to posaconazole and enhanced stability without inhibiting Cyp3A4. In addition, we utilized a series of molecular dynamics and binding energy studies to probe specific interactions between the compounds and their proposed binding site on Smoothened.

One is the formation of a new hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and CCR5. The other is restricting the conformation of the compound to favorably orient the side chains.

However, I did find a description of the experimental assays used to measure the activity of the compounds against the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and other nuclear receptors.

The activity assays used to measure the potency of the compounds as GR agonists are described in the paper as follows:

* GR binding assays: The compounds were assayed for their ability to bind to GR using competition experiments with fluorescent-labelled dexamethasone.
* Functional GR agonist assay: The compounds were tested for their ability to repress transcription using human A549 lung epithelial cells engineered to contain a secreted placental alkaline phosphatase gene under the control of the NFκB dependent ELAM promoter.
* Transactivation activity assay: The compounds were tested for their ability to activate transcription using human A549 lung epithelial cells engineered to contain a renilla luciferase gene under the control of the distal region of the LTR from the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV).
* Nuclear receptor selectivity assays: The compounds were tested for their selectivity for GR over other nuclear receptors, such as the progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR), using binding assays and functional assays using an MMTV-luciferase reporter in monkey kidney CV1 cells.

I would rate the quality of these assays as 0.8 out of 1, as they appear to be well-established and widely used methods for measuring the activity of GR agonists. However, I would like to note that the description of the assays is brief and lacks some details, which may affect the overall quality of the results.

Regarding the P450 inhibition assay, the paper describes a fluorimetric assay using bactosomes expressing the appropriate cytochrome P450 (Cypex Ltd, Dundee, UK) and a fluorescent plate reader methodology using a seven-point IC50 curve.

""FLIPR assay protocol: HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human motilin receptor were seeded (30,000 cells/100 μL growth media/well) into poly-d -lysine coated 96-well black-wall, clear-bottom microtitre plates (Corning) 24 h prior to assay. On the day of assay the cells were loaded with 2 μΜ (final) Fluo-4-AM fluorescent indicator dye (Molecular Probes) and 1 mM (final) probenicid in assay buffer (145 mM sodium chloride, 2.5 mM potassium chloride, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mM glucose, 1.2 mM magnesium chloride, 1.5 mM calcium chloride and 0.1% BSA) (50 μL loading solution added to each well). Plates were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, before being washed four times with 100 μL assay buffer using the EMBLA cell washer; 150 μL residual being left after the final wash. The cells were then incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and the plates were then assayed on a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices). Test compounds were prepared in assay buffer without probenecid. In the FLIPR, 50 μL of test compound was added to the cells and changes in fluorescence measured over a 2-min timeframe. Maximum change in fluorescence over baseline was used to determine agonist response and concentration response curves were constructed, using a 4-parameter logistic equation. All compounds were full agonists in this assay.""

Although in vitro activity loss assays failed to demonstrate CYP3A4 time-dependent inhibition (TDI) with AMG 487, its M2 phenol metabolite readily produced TDI when remaining activity was assessed using either midazolam or testosterone (K(I) = 0.73-0.74 μM, k(inact) = 0.088-0.099 min(-1)). TDI investigations using an IC(50) shift method successfully produced inhibition attributable to AMG 487, but only when preincubations were extended from 30 to 90 min. The shift magnitude was ∼3× for midazolam activity, but no shift was observed for testosterone activity. Subsequent partition ratio determinations conducted for M2 using recombinant CYP3A4 showed that inactivation was a relatively inefficient process (r = 36). CYP3A4-mediated biotransformation of [(3)H]M2 in the presence of GSH led to identification of two new metabolites, M4 and M5, which shifted focus away from M2 being directly responsible for TDI.

The imidazole-bearing antifungals more effectively reduced trailing growth associated with persistence and/or recurrence of fungal infections than triazole-based derivatives. The imidazole derivatives were more toxic to mammalian cells and more potently inhibited the activity of CYP3A4, which is one of the main causes of azole toxicity.

Similar to the marketed ketolide telithromycin, the non-ketolide 34a proved to be a time-dependent bactericidal agent, but it exhibited superior in vivo pharmacokinetic properties such as longer half-life, higher plasma concentration, lower clearance and shorter time to reach the highest drug concentration relative to telithromycin. Molecular docking suggested 34a might π - π interact with the bacterial ribosomal RNA base G2505Ec. This study suggested that the bacteriostatic agent erythromycin can be structurally modified to afford a new bactericidal chemotype that targets the ribosome and is superior to ciprofloxacin with regard to its minimum bactericidal concentration.","The paper describes the synthesis and structure-activity relationships of non-ketolides, a new class of antibiotics that are derived from erythromycin. The authors designed and synthesized a series of non-ketolides with varying linker chain lengths and rigidities, and tested their antibacterial activity against a panel of erythromycin-resistant and erythromycin-susceptible clinical isolates and ATCC strains.

The results showed that the most potent non-ketolide, 34a, featured a 5-atom-length flexible linker anchored with a pyridyl group, and exhibited superior bactericidal activity against inducibly resistant S. aureus PU32, susceptible S. pneumoniae ATCC49619, and efflux-resistant S. pneumoniae PU09. The authors also found that the bactericidal activity of 34a was comparable to that of telithromycin, a marketed ketolide antibiotic.

The authors used molecular modeling to investigate the binding mode of 34a to the bacterial ribosome, and found that it interacted with the bacterial ribosomal base G2484Dr (G2505Ec) via π-π stacking. They also tested the in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of 34a in male SD rats via oral administration and found that it exhibited superior PK properties compared to telithromycin.

However, the authors noted that 34a was a medium inhibitor of human liver CYP 3A4, which could lead to drug-drug interactions.

The authors concluded that the study demonstrated the potential of non-ketolides as a new class of antibiotics with improved bactericidal activity against resistant pathogens, and that further structural modification of 34a could lead to safer and more effective non-ketolide candidates.

Here we report the discovery of a series of novel adamantyl carboxamide and acetamide derivatives as selective inhibitors of human 11β-HSD1 in HEK-293 cells transfected with the HSD11B1 gene. Optimization based on an initially identified 11β-HSD1 inhibitor (3) led to the discovery of potent inhibitors with IC(50) values in the 100 nM range.

""4.1 11β-HSD1 inhibition assay protocol: human HEK-293 cell based assay

The cell-based assays were conducted on the human HEK-293 cell line stably transfected with the HSD11B1 gene. 11β-HSD1 activity was determined by measuring the amount of tritiated product formed using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA). Cells were incubated in 96-well micro-plates in the presence of tritiated cortisone substrate and the assay plates contained internal high and low controls to allow calculation of percentage inhibition. Each well of a 96-well culture plate was seeded with human 11β-HSD1 overexpressed HEK293 cells in 100 μL medium. When the cells were 80% confluent, the medium was removed from each well then 100 μL of fresh, serum-free, medium containing 3 H-cortisone (22 nM) and test compound in 1% DMSO was added. The control wells were also dispensed. The high control wells did not contain compound, while low controls did not contain cells. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, after which 50 μL of medium was removed from each well and transferred to a microplate containing 100 μL of a pre-incubated mixture of anti-cortisol antibody and SPA bead. The mixture was incubated with gentle shaking until equilibrium was reached, before transferring to a scintillation counter to establish the enzyme activity in each sample. The compounds were initially tested at a concentration of 1 μM. Those compounds showing over 70% inhibition of 11β-HSD1 at 1 μM were subjected to an IC50 measurement. A Merck compound 544 was used as the reference compound in the assay (IC50 = 50 ± 20 nM). The IC50 values are reported as the mean value of 3 measurements with variance less than 20%. IC50 values were calculated from the dose-response curve using Microsoft Excel add-in XLfit with a Four Parameter Logistic nonlinear regression model.""

""The reaction mixture contained 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 10 pmol/mL recombinant CYP3A4 (Gentest), 100 μM testosterone, NADPH regenerating system (0.5 mM NADP (Oriental Yeast)), 5 mM glucose-6-phosphate (Oriental Yeast), 1 mM MgCl2, 1.5 unit/mL G-6-P dehydrogenase (Oriental Yeast), and 1 or 10 μM test compounds in a total volume of 200 μL.

Rapid in vitro testing for CYP 3A4 high affinity/high inhibition potential has become part of the standard investigations for new drug candidates. Unfortunately, the complexity of the kinetics associated with CYP 3A4 catalyzed reactions (multiple substrates binding, non Michaelis-Menten kinetics) make these tests either inaccurate or tedious. We have designed and synthesized a new fluorescent probe, a testosterone substituted at the 6beta- position with a fluorescent deazaflavine moiety which is able to inhibit to the same extent the hydroxylation of compounds known to bind to different sites in the CYP 3A4 active site. Furthermore, the binding of this compound and its displacement from the active site can be followed by fluorescence measurements, which allows a rapid evaluation of the CYP 3A4 affinity of any new drug candidate.","The experimental assay used to measure IC50 activity values against the target Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is described in the paper as follows:

""The results, summarized in Table 1, show that the IC50 obtained with the three substrates are all of the same order of magnitude and in the desired range (1–5 μM). Each assay corresponds to a different substrate binding mode in the active site of the enzyme.

The specific details of the assay are not described in the paper, but it appears to be a standard enzyme inhibition assay using CYP3A4 as the target enzyme and testosterone, midazolam, and nifedipine as substrates.

I would give a confidence score of 0.8 out of 1 for the quality of the results produced by the assay. The reason for this score is that the paper does not provide detailed information about the assay conditions, such as the concentration of the enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor, or the incubation time and temperature. However, the fact that the IC50 values obtained with the three substrates are all of the same order of magnitude and in the desired range suggests that the assay is robust and reliable.

The paper also describes the in vitro profiles for selected pyrrolidine inhibitors, which include CYP3A4 inhibition, hERG binding, metabolic stability in rat and human liver microsomes, and Caco-2 permeability. These data are presented in Table 4.

The supernatant was collected and recombinant human renin (Proteos) added at 1 nM nominal concentration. The plasma was transferred to Costar black 384 well plates, renin inhibitors added and the mixture pre-incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The renin Q-FRET substrate QXL520-Lys-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Val-Ile-His-Lys-(5-FAM) (Proteos), diluted in 3 M Tris/200 mM EDTA, pH 7.2 was added to the plasma with final concentrations of 342 mM Tris, 23 mM EDTA and 6.8 μM substrate.

This passage mentions that the IC50 values were determined using a method described in a reference (Zhang et al., 2004), but it does not provide a detailed description of the assay used.

However, the passage does mention that the compounds were tested using a fluorescence polarization (FP) peptide displacement assay, which is a common method for measuring the binding affinity of small molecules to proteins.

The passage also mentions that the IC50 values were determined as described in Zhang et al. (2004), which is likely a reference to a specific method or protocol for determining IC50 values.

As for the quality of the results produced by the assay, it is difficult to provide a confidence score without more information about the assay and its performance. However, based on the fact that the authors were able to identify several potent HDM2 inhibitors with IC50 values in the low single-digit micromolar range, it is likely that the assay was reliable and produced accurate results.

It is mainly expressed in extrahepatic tissues, including intestine and cardiovascular systems. The general role of CYP2J2 in drug metabolism is not yet fully understood, and the recent discovery that CYP2J2 can metabolize a wide range of structurally diverse drugs and its primary distribution in the intestine suggest its potentially indispensable role in first-pass intestinal metabolism and involvement in drug-drug interaction. To fully characterize its role in drug metabolism, selective and potent inhibitors of CYP2J2 are necessary tools. In the current study, 69 known drugs were screened for the inhibition of CYP2J2, and we discovered a number of marketed drugs as potent and selective CYP2J2 inhibitors. In particular, telmisartan and flunarizine have CYP2J2 inhibition IC(50) values of 0.42 μM and 0.94 μM, respectively, which are at least 10-fold more selective against all other major metabolizing CYPs; moreover, they are not substrates of CYP2J2 and show no time-dependent inhibition toward this CYP.

Amiodarone 4-hydroxylation correlated with astemizole O-demethylation but not with CYP2J2 protein content in a sample of human liver microsomes. To identify a specific CYP2J2 inhibitor, 138 drugs were screened using terfenadine and astemizole as probe substrates with recombinant CYP2J2. Forty-two drugs inhibited CYP2J2 activity by ≥50% at 30 μM, but inhibition was substrate-dependent. Of these, danazol was a potent inhibitor of both hydroxylation of terfenadine (IC(50) = 77 nM) and O-demethylation of astemizole (K(i) = 20 nM), and inhibition was mostly competitive. Danazol inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6 with IC(50) values of 1.44, 1.95, and 2.74 μM, respectively. Amiodarone or astemizole were included in a seven-probe cocktail for cytochrome P450 (P450) drug-interaction screening potential, and astemizole demonstrated a better profile because it did not appreciably interact with other P450 probes. Thus, danazol, amiodarone, and astemizole will facilitate the ability to determine the metabolic role of CYP2J2 in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues.",,1.24551266781415

The assays are based on the capacity of a given drug to inhibit or to increase the metabolism of a specific substrate of the CYP yielding in a fluorescent metabolite. In that context, microsomes from insect cells transfected with a baculovirus expressing individual human CYP450 subtypes were prepared.33   The drugs were incubated with the microsomes, the specific CYP substrate was added, and the kinetics of the substrate metabolism was established using fluorescence.

This was spiked into 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mg/mL microsomal protein to give a final incubation concentration of 0.5 μM substrate after the addition of NADP co-factor solution. The solutions were mixed well and pre-incubated for 5 min at ca. 37 °C before the reaction was started with the addition of co-factor. Samples (50 μL) were then taken at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24 and 30 min and at 30 min for the controls into 200 μL acetonitrile containing internal standard.

In this passage, the IC50 values for CYP3A4 (T/M/TDI) are reported, which is the target enzyme of interest. The quality of the results produced by this assay is high, given that the IC50 values are reported as a ratio of three different values (T/M/TDI), which suggests a well-designed and controlled experiment.

I would assign a confidence score of 0.9 out of 1.0 to the quality of the results produced by this assay, based on the following factors:

* The IC50 values are reported as a ratio, which suggests a well-controlled experiment.
* The IC50 values are reported with three decimal places, which suggests a high level of precision.
* The assay is likely a standard P450 enzyme inhibition assay, which is a well-established and widely used method for measuring CYP3A4 activity.

However, monotherapy with artemisinin drugs results in comparatively high recrudescence rates. Autoinduction of cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated metabolism, resulting in reduced exposure, has been supposed to be the underlying mechanism. To better understand the autoinduction and metabolic drug-drug interactions (DDIs), we evaluated the P450s (particularly CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) inhibited or induced by two artemisinin drugs, Qing-hao-su (QHS) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) using human liver microsome, recombinant P450 enzymes, and primary human hepatocytes. The results suggested that QHS was a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP2B6 (K(i) 4.6 μM), but not CYP3A4 (IC₅₀ ∼ 50 μM) and did not show measurable time-dependent inhibition of either CYP2B6 or CYP3A4. DHA inhibited neither CYP2B6 nor CYP3A4 (IC₅₀ > 125 μM). In addition, it was found that QHS induced the activity of CYP3A4 (E(max) 3.5-fold and EC₅₀ 5.9 μM) and CYP2B6 (E(max) 1.9-fold and EC₅₀ 0.6 μM). Of the other P450s, UDP glucuronosyltransferases, and transporters studied, QHS and DHA had no significant effect except for minor induction of mRNA expression of CYP1A2 (E(max) 7.9-fold and EC₅₀ 5.2 μM) and CYP2A6 (E(max) 11.7-fold and EC₅₀ 4.0 μM) by QHS. Quantitative prediction of P450-mediated DDIs indicate autoinduction of QHS clearance with the AUC(i)/AUC ratio decreasing to 59%, as a result of a 1.9-fold increase in CYP3A4 and a 1.6-fold increase in CYP2B6 activity. These data suggest that QHS drugs are potential inducers of P450 enzymes, and the possible drug interactions (or lack thereof) with artemisinin drugs may be clinically relevant.",,1.6989700043360187

""FLIPR assay protocol: HEK-293 cells stably expressing the human motilin receptor were seeded (30,000 cells/100 μL growth media/well) into poly-d -lysine coated 96-well black-wall, clear-bottom microtitre plates (Corning) 24 h prior to assay. On the day of assay the cells were loaded with 2 μΜ (final) Fluo-4-AM fluorescent indicator dye (Molecular Probes) and 1 mM (final) probenicid in assay buffer (145 mM sodium chloride, 2.5 mM potassium chloride, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mM glucose, 1.2 mM magnesium chloride, 1.5 mM calcium chloride and 0.1% BSA) (50 μL loading solution added to each well). Plates were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, before being washed four times with 100 μL assay buffer using the EMBLA cell washer; 150 μL residual being left after the final wash. The cells were then incubated at 25 °C for 20 min and the plates were then assayed on a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices). Test compounds were prepared in assay buffer without probenecid. In the FLIPR, 50 μL of test compound was added to the cells and changes in fluorescence measured over a 2-min timeframe. Maximum change in fluorescence over baseline was used to determine agonist response and concentration response curves were constructed, using a 4-parameter logistic equation. All compounds were full agonists in this assay.""

Compound 9c also demonstrated high selectivity against other CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4.

To measure the IC50 activity values against CYP17, the authors used a biochemical assay that involved measuring the conversion of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione. The assay was performed using rat testes microsomes as the enzyme source.

The authors also evaluated the compounds for their ability to inhibit testosterone production in NCI-H295R cells, a human adrenal corticocarcinoma cell line. At a concentration of 1 μM, compound 9c inhibited testosterone production by 52±2%, which was more potent than abiraterone (74±15%).

In a separate experiment, the authors evaluated the ability of compound 9c to reduce plasma testosterone levels in male rats. The results showed that compound 9c significantly decreased serum testosterone concentration in a dose-dependent manner.

The authors also performed molecular modeling studies to understand the interactions between the synthesized compounds and CYP17. The docking pose of compound 9c overlapped well with TOK-001, and it formed a coordinate bond with the heme iron through the nitrogen of the 4-methylpyridine.

The confidence score for the quality of results produced by the assay is 0.8, as the authors provide detailed information about the experimental procedure, including the enzyme source, substrate, and reaction conditions. The assay was also performed in triplicate, which increases the reliability of the results. However, the authors do not provide information about the inter-assay variability or the reproducibility of the results.

In this Article, we highlight our strategy toward the identification of CNS-penetrant S1P(3)-sparing S1P(1) and S1P(5) agonists resulting in the discovery of 5-(3-{2-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-5-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-isoquinolinyl}-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-2-[(1-methylethyl)oxy]benzonitrile 15.

The table lists the IC50 values for various compounds against CYP3A4 using two different assays: the 3A4 DEF assay, which uses diethoxyfluorescein as the CYP3A4 substrate, and the 3A4 7BQ assay, which uses 7-benzyloxyquinoline.

The confidence score for the quality of the results produced by the assay is 0.8. The assays are described in a clear and concise manner, and the data is presented in a well-organized table. However, there is no detailed description of the experimental procedures or the assay conditions, which might reduce the confidence in the results. Additionally, the table only presents IC50 values for a limited number of compounds, which might not be representative of the entire dataset.

The passage also mentions that the IC50 values were determined using a time-dependent inhibition assay (TDI), which is a measure of the ability of a compound to inhibit CYP3A4 over time. However, the details of the TDI assay are not provided.

Overall, while the passage provides useful information on the IC50 values for various compounds against CYP3A4, the lack of detailed experimental procedures and assay conditions reduces the confidence in the results.",1.146128035678238

However, none of them describe an assay specifically designed to measure IC50 activity values against the target Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).

The closest passage that describes an activity assay related to CYP3A4 is in Table 3, which lists the IC50 values for CYP inhibition. Specifically, it shows the IC50 values for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibition by sulfamide 17, but the values are not explicitly described as being measured using a specific assay.

However, there are several passages that describe various activity assays used to evaluate the compounds, including:

The experimental assay used to measure PXR transactivation is not explicitly described, but it is mentioned that the PXR transactivation of over 400 compounds within the benzimidazole-pyridone chemotype was measured as part of ongoing research towards an ATP competitive small molecule inhibitor of IGF-1R kinase.

The experimental assay used to measure IGF-1R kinase inhibition is not explicitly described, but it is mentioned that the IGF-1R kinase IC50 values were measured for various compounds.

The experimental assay used to measure CYP3A4 inhibition is described as follows:

""CYP3A4 inhibition, 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin was used as probe molecule.""

The quality of the results produced by the assay is not explicitly described, but it is mentioned that the compounds were evaluated in different mouse tumor xenograft models and that the results were consistent with the expected pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds.

Therefore, I would assign a confidence score of 0.5 to the quality of the results produced by the assay, as the experimental design and methods are not explicitly described, but the results are consistent with the expected pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds.

However, there is a description of the experimental assay used to measure CYP3A4 inhibition, which is presented in Table 1.

The CYP3A4 inhibition data is presented as IC50 values, which represent the concentration of the compound required to inhibit 50% of the CYP3A4 enzyme activity. The IC50 values are determined for inhibition of dealkylation of BFC (7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin).

Based on the description, I would assign a confidence score of 0.6 out of 1 for the quality of the results produced by the assay. This is because the IC50 values are determined using a standard substrate (BFC) and a common method for measuring CYP3A4 inhibition, but the details of the assay protocol are not provided. Additionally, the IC50 values are reported as averages of two determinations, which suggests that there may be some variability in the results.

When investigating its inhibitory properties, an extreme metabolic inactivation efficiency (k(inact)/K(I)) of 3300 to 3800 ml · min⁻¹ · μmol⁻¹ was observed using human liver microsomes from donors of nonfunctioning CYP3A5 (CYP3A5 *3/*3). This observed efficiency equated to an apparent K(I) between 420 and 480 nM with a maximal inactivation rate (k(inact)) equal to 1.6 min⁻¹. Similar results were achieved with testosterone, another CYP3A substrate, and other sources of the CYP3A4 enzyme. To further illustrate the abilities of CYP3cide, its partition ratio of inactivation was determined with recombinant CYP3A4. These studies produced a partition ratio approaching unity, thus underscoring the inactivation capacity of CYP3cide. When CYP3cide was tested at a concentration and preincubation time to completely inhibit CYP3A4 in a library of genotyped polymorphic CYP3A5 microsomes, the correlation of the remaining midazolam 1'-hydroxylase activity to CYP3A5 abundance was significant (R² value equal to 0.51, p value of <0.0001). The work presented here supports these findings by fully characterizing the inhibitory properties and exploring CYP3cide's mechanism of action. To aid the researcher, multiple commercially available sources of CYP3cide were established, and a protocol was developed to quantitatively determine CYP3A4 contribution to the metabolism of an investigational compound.

""4.1 11β-HSD1 inhibition assay protocol: human HEK-293 cell based assay

The cell-based assays were conducted on the human HEK-293 cell line stably transfected with the HSD11B1 gene. 11β-HSD1 activity was determined by measuring the amount of tritiated product formed using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA). Cells were incubated in 96-well micro-plates in the presence of tritiated cortisone substrate and the assay plates contained internal high and low controls to allow calculation of percentage inhibition. Each well of a 96-well culture plate was seeded with human 11β-HSD1 overexpressed HEK293 cells in 100 μL medium. When the cells were 80% confluent, the medium was removed from each well then 100 μL of fresh, serum-free, medium containing 3 H-cortisone (22 nM) and test compound in 1% DMSO was added. The control wells were also dispensed. The high control wells did not contain compound, while low controls did not contain cells. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, after which 50 μL of medium was removed from each well and transferred to a microplate containing 100 μL of a pre-incubated mixture of anti-cortisol antibody and SPA bead. The mixture was incubated with gentle shaking until equilibrium was reached, before transferring to a scintillation counter to establish the enzyme activity in each sample. The compounds were initially tested at a concentration of 1 μM. Those compounds showing over 70% inhibition of 11β-HSD1 at 1 μM were subjected to an IC50 measurement. A Merck compound 544 was used as the reference compound in the assay (IC50 = 50 ± 20 nM). The IC50 values are reported as the mean value of 3 measurements with variance less than 20%. IC50 values were calculated from the dose-response curve using Microsoft Excel add-in XLfit with a Four Parameter Logistic nonlinear regression model.""

""To investigate whether our strategy to reduce metabolism within the benzimidazole framework could be extended beyond mitigating genotoxicity risk, we measured the inhibitory effect of 1 and 8 on CYP3A4-mediated biotransformation, including irreversible (or time-dependent) inactivation. In the absence of compound pre-incubation, 1 was a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 (IC50 = 7.3 μM), and the monomethyl analog 8 was a much weaker CYP3A4 inhibitor (IC50 >50 μM). This result is consistent with our Ames findings for 1 and 8, where we proposed stronger binding of 1 to CYP3A4 increased the potential for metabolic activation and subsequent genotoxic risk. Pre-incubation (30 min) of 1 with human liver microsomes and the cofactor NADPH further exacerbated this CYP3A4 inhibition as evidenced by the 2.7-fold shift in IC50 (IC50 following pre-incubation = 2.7 μM), whereas compound 8 still showed no CYP3A4 inhibition under these conditions (IC50 >50 μM).""

The confidence score for the quality of the results produced by the assay is 0.8. The assays are described in a clear and concise manner, and the data is presented in a well-organized table.

However, there are descriptions of activity assays for other targets, including H+ /K+ ATPase and parietal cell assays.

Table 1 in the paper describes the IC50 values for a series of compounds against CYP3A4, using two different assays: the 3A4 DEF assay and the 3A4 7BQ assay. The IC50 values are reported as μM. The 3A4 DEF assay uses diethoxyfluorescein as a CYP3A4 substrate, while the 3A4 7BQ assay uses 7-benzyloxyquinoline.

The confidence score for the quality of results produced by these assays is 0.8, as the IC50 values are reported as μM and the assays are described as using specific substrates for CYP3A4, but the experimental details are not provided.

It's worth noting that the paper focuses on the evaluation of basic, heterocyclic ring systems as templates for use as potassium competitive acid blockers (pCABs), and the CYP3A4 assays are not the main focus of the paper.",0.9542425094393249

Here we report an investigation of the activity of coumarin-substituted azole antifungals. Screening against a panel of Candida pathogens, including a mutant lacking CYP51, the target of antifungal azoles, revealed that this enzyme is inhibited by triazole-based antifungals, whereas imidazole-based derivatives have more than one mode of action. The imidazole-bearing antifungals more effectively reduced trailing growth associated with persistence and/or recurrence of fungal infections than triazole-based derivatives. The imidazole derivatives were more toxic to mammalian cells and more potently inhibited the activity of CYP3A4, which is one of the main causes of azole toxicity. Using live cell imaging, we showed that regardless of the type of azole ring fluorescent 7-diethylaminocoumarin-based azoles localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, the organelle that harbors CYP51. This study suggests that the coumarin is a promising scaffold for development of novel azole-based antifungals that effectively localize to the fungal cell endoplasmic reticulum.","The experimental assay used to measure IC50 activity values against the target CYP3A4 is described in the section ""4.2 Biological assays"" under the subheading ""CYP3A4 inhibition assay"".

The assay mixture was mixed briefly, and the plate was incubated at 37°C. After 15 min, 50 μL of reconstituted Luciferin Detection Reagent (Promega) was then added to all the wells to terminate the CYP3A4 reaction.

We synthesized tipifarnib analogues that no longer bind to protein farnesyltransferase and display increased potency for killing parasites. This was achieved in a structure-guided fashion by changing the substituents attached to the phenyl group at the 4-position of the quinoline ring of tipifarnib and by replacing the amino group by OMe. Several compounds that kill Trypanosoma cruzi at subnanomolar concentrations and are devoid of protein farnesyltransferase inhibition were discovered.

Increasing the number and diversity of hits available for assessment at the beginning of the discovery process will help to achieve this aim. Results: We report the evaluation of multiple hits generated from a high-throughput screen to identify inhibitors of T. cruzi and from these studies the discovery of two novel series currently in lead optimization. Lead compounds from these series potently and selectively inhibit growth of T. cruzi in vitro and the most advanced compound is orally active in a subchronic mouse model of T. cruzi infection.

The number of deaths attributable to diabetes reflects the insufficient glycemic control achieved with the treatments used in recent past. DPP-4 inhibitors have been investigated as a new therapy with novel mechanisms of action and improved tolerability. DPP-4, a protease that specifically cleaves dipeptides from proteins and oligopeptides after a penultimate N-terminal proline or alanine, is involved in the degradation of a number of neuropeptides, peptide hormones and cytokines, including the incretins GLP-1 and GIP. As soon as released from the gut in response to food intake, GLP-1 and GIP exert a potent glucose-dependent insulinotropic action, thereby playing a key role in the maintenance of post-meal glycemic control. Consequently, inhibiting DPP-4 prolongs the action of GLP-1 and GIP, which in turn improves glucose homeostasis with a low risk of hypoglycemia and potential for disease modification. Indeed, clinical trials involving diabetic patients have shown improved glucose control by administering DPP-4 inhibitors, thus demonstrating the benefit of this promising new class of antidiabetics. Intense research activities in this area have resulted in the launch of sitagliptin and vildagliptin (in Europe only) and the advancement of a few others into preregistration/phase 3, for example, saxagliptin, alogliptin and ABT-279. Achieving desired selectivity for DPP-4 over other related peptidases such as DPP-8 and DPP-9 (inhibition of which was linked to toxicity in animal studies) and long-acting potential for maximal efficacy (particularly in more severe diabetic patients) were the major challenges. Whether these goals are achieved with the present series of inhibitors in the advanced stages of clinical development is yet to be confirmed. Nevertheless, treatment of this metabolic disorder especially in the early stages of the disease via DPP-4 inhibition has been recognized as a validated principle and a large number of inhibitors are presently in various stage of pre-clinical/clinical development. Sitagliptin is a new weapon in the arsenal of oral antihyperglycemic agents. This review will focus on the journey of drug discovery of DPP-4 inhibitors for oral delivery covering a brief scientific background and medicinal chemistry approaches along with the status of advanced clinical candidates.","The provided paper discusses the medicinal chemistry approaches to the inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The paper highlights the importance of DPP-4 inhibitors as a new class of antidiabetic agents and reviews the design and structure-activity relationships of DPP-4 inhibitors reported over the last 10 years.

However, there is no description of an assay for measuring IC50 activity values against the target Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) in the provided paper.

The paper does describe various assays for measuring the activity of DPP-4 inhibitors, including:

1. In vitro assays: These assays involve measuring the ability of the inhibitors to inhibit DPP-4 activity in cell-free systems.
2. In vivo assays: These assays involve measuring the ability of the inhibitors to lower blood glucose levels in animal models of diabetes.
3. Ex vivo assays: These assays involve measuring the ability of the inhibitors to inhibit DPP-4 activity in isolated tissues or cells.

The paper also describes the use of various biochemical assays to evaluate the selectivity and potency of DPP-4 inhibitors, including:

1. Inhibition constant (K_i) assays: These assays involve measuring the ability of the inhibitors to inhibit DPP-4 activity in a competitive manner.
2. IC50 assays: These assays involve measuring the concentration of the inhibitor required to inhibit DPP-4 activity by 50%.
3. Selectivity assays: These assays involve measuring the ability of the inhibitors to selectively inhibit DPP-4 activity over other related enzymes.

The paper also describes the use of X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of DPP-4 and its interactions with inhibitors.

Based on the description of the assays, I would rate the quality of the results produced by the assay as 0.8 out of 1. The assays described in the paper are well-established and widely used in the field of medicinal chemistry, and the results obtained from these assays are likely to be reliable and accurate. However, the paper does not provide detailed information on the experimental conditions and protocols used in the assays, which may limit the reproducibility of the results.

The paper also highlights the importance of selectivity and potency in DPP-4 inhibitors, and the use of various biochemical assays to evaluate these properties. The authors also discuss the potential of DPP-4 inhibitors to treat various diseases beyond diabetes, including obesity and intestinal injury.

This passage describes the CYP450 inhibition data for compounds 1, (±)-2, (−)-2, and (+)-2, including their IC50 values against CYP3A4/5. The IC50 values for (±)-2, (−)-2, and (+)-2 are <10%, 139 μM, and 159 μM, respectively.

I would assign a confidence score of 0.8 out of 1 for the quality of the results produced by this assay. The reason for this score is that the assay appears to be a standard CYP450 inhibition assay using human microsomes, which is a well-established method for measuring CYP450 activity. However, the IC50 values are reported as <10% for (±)-2 and <10% for (+)-2, which suggests that the assay may not have been able to accurately determine the IC50 values for these compounds. Additionally, the IC50 value for (−)-2 is reported as 139 μM, which is a relatively high value, suggesting that this compound may not be a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Overall, while the assay appears to be well-designed, the results may not be as reliable as they could be due to the limitations of the assay.

However, the fact that the IC50 values are reported for multiple CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4, suggests that the assay was performed using a standard protocol and that the results are likely to be reliable.

The assay appears to be a traditional CYP inhibition assay, where the test compound is incubated with a cDNA-expressed human CYP enzyme and a substrate, and the formation of the metabolite is measured. The IC50 value is then determined based on the concentration of the test compound required to inhibit the enzyme activity by 50%.

The assay was conducted using commercial recombinant 3A4 enzymes and measuring the appearance of fluorescent products from non-fluorescent substrates. The data for the pre-incubation experiment was collected 30 minutes after addition of the compound to the assay system. Known CYP inhibitors, sulfaphenazole and ketoconazole, were used as positive controls.

The quality of the results produced by this assay is high, as it is a well-established and widely used method for measuring CYP3A4 activity. The use of commercial recombinant enzymes and fluorescent substrates ensures high specificity and sensitivity, and the inclusion of positive controls provides a reference point for the results.

However, the description of the assay is brief and lacks specific details about the experimental conditions, such as the concentration of the enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor, as well as the reaction time and temperature. This lack of detail may reduce the confidence in the quality of the results.

To fully assess the role of CYP2J2 in drug metabolism, a selective substrate and potent specific chemical inhibitor are essential. In this study, we report amiodarone 4-hydoxylation as a specific CYP2J2-catalyzed reaction with no CYP3A4, or other drug-metabolizing enzyme, involvement. Amiodarone 4-hydroxylation enabled the determination of liver relative activity factor and intersystem extrapolation factor for CYP2J2. Amiodarone 4-hydroxylation correlated with astemizole O-demethylation but not with CYP2J2 protein content in a sample of human liver microsomes. To identify a specific CYP2J2 inhibitor, 138 drugs were screened using terfenadine and astemizole as probe substrates with recombinant CYP2J2. Forty-two drugs inhibited CYP2J2 activity by ≥50% at 30 μM, but inhibition was substrate-dependent. Of these, danazol was a potent inhibitor of both hydroxylation of terfenadine (IC(50) = 77 nM) and O-demethylation of astemizole (K(i) = 20 nM), and inhibition was mostly competitive. Danazol inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6 with IC(50) values of 1.44, 1.95, and 2.74 μM, respectively. Amiodarone or astemizole were included in a seven-probe cocktail for cytochrome P450 (P450) drug-interaction screening potential, and astemizole demonstrated a better profile because it did not appreciably interact with other P450 probes.

Chem.2012, 55, 4594]. The key design feature was the shift of the attachment of the five-membered heterocyclic ring towards the B ring while maintaining the key hydroxamate and anilino pharamcophoric elements in a remarkably similar position as in G-925. From modelling, changing the connection point of the five membered ring heterocycle placed the H-bond accepting nitrogen within a good distance and angle to the Ser212 [J. Med. Chem.2012, 55, 4594].

The 6,5-imidazo[1,5-a] pyridine scaffold was further diversified by incorporating a nitrogen at the 7 position to give the imidazo[1,5-a] pyrazine scaffold. The introduction of the C7 nitrogen was driven by the desire to improve metabolic stability by blocking metabolism at the C7 and C8 positions (particularly the HLM stability). It was found that improving on G-868 (later renamed GDC-0623) required combining C7 nitrogen with a diol hydroxamate to give G-479.

Throughout our NAMPT inhibitor program, we found that exposed pyridines or related heterocyclic systems in the left-hand portion of the inhibitors are necessary pharmacophores for potent cellular NAMPT inhibition. However, when combined with a benzyl group in the center of the inhibitors, such pyridine-like moieties also led to consistent and potent inhibition of CYP2C9. In an attempt to reduce CYP2C9 inhibition, a parallel synthesis approach was used to identify central benzyl group replacements with increased Fsp3. A spirocyclic central motif was thus discovered that was combined with left-hand pyridines (or pyridine-like systems) to provide cellularly potent NAMPT inhibitors with minimal CYP2C9 inhibition.

PLK4 has been identified as a candidate anticancer target which prompted a search for potent and selective inhibitors of PLK4. The body of the paper describes lead generation and optimization work which yielded nanomolar PLK4 inhibitors. Lead generation began with directed virtual screening, using a ligand-based focused library and a PLK4 homology model. Validated hits were used as starting points for the design and discovery of PLK4 inhibitors of novel structure, namely (E)-3-((1H-indazol-6-yl)methylene)indolin-2-ones. Computational models, based on a published X-ray structure (PLK4 kinase domain), were used to understand and optimize the in vitro activity of the series; potent antiproliferative activity was obtained. The kinase selectivity profile and cell cycle analysis of selected inhibitors are described. The results of a xenograft study with an optimized compound 50 (designated CFI-400437) support the potential of these novel PLK4 inhibitors for cancer therapy.",,0.43136376415898736

Here we report an investigation of the activity of coumarin-substituted azole antifungals. Screening against a panel of Candida pathogens, including a mutant lacking CYP51, the target of antifungal azoles, revealed that this enzyme is inhibited by triazole-based antifungals, whereas imidazole-based derivatives have more than one mode of action. The imidazole-bearing antifungals more effectively reduced trailing growth associated with persistence and/or recurrence of fungal infections than triazole-based derivatives. The imidazole derivatives were more toxic to mammalian cells and more potently inhibited the activity of CYP3A4, which is one of the main causes of azole toxicity.

In addition, many CYPs may serve as targets for disease treatment. However, due to the presence of a common heme, the hydrophobicity of the CYP binding cavity, and the high homology within the binding pocket, most CYP inhibitors lack selectivity, which often leads to drug-drug interactions. Therefore, it is meaningful to develop highly selective CYP inhibitors. In this review, we summarize some of the strategies that have been used to develop highly selective CYP inhibitors, such as the weakening of the heme-binding group interaction, reduction of molecular lipophilicity and introduction of small structural changes within compounds.","The experimental assay used to measure IC50 activity values against the target Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is described in several tables in the paper.

The third passage that describes the assay is in Table 4, which presents the IC50 values of compounds 13-16 toward CYP17 and CYP3A4. The IC50 values are reported in nanomoles (nM).

The fourth passage that describes the assay is in Table 13, which presents the in vitro CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inhibition assessment of compounds 46-53. The IC50 values of these compounds against CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are reported in micromoles (μM).

The fifth passage that describes the assay is in Table 14, which presents the inhibition of CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 by compounds 54-57. The IC50 values of these compounds against CYP11B2 are reported in nanomoles (nM).

Among the tested compounds, the ethoxy compound 5h with high hSGLT2 selectivity exhibited more potent and longer hypoglycemic action in db/db mice than our O-carbasugar compound (1) and sergliflozin (2), which could be explained by its improved PK profiles relative to those of the two compounds.

4.3.2 CYP3A4 inhibition assay10

The evaluation of CYP3A inhibition was carried out on 96-well microtiter plates using MultiPROBE II EX Liquid Handling Robotics (PerkinElmerJapan, Yokohama, Japan). Fluorescence detection of the metabolite of 7-benzyloxy–4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin (BFC) was performed using a Spectra Max Gemini microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Incubations and calculations of IC50 were conducted based on the method provided on the BD Biosciences website. IC50 (–) and IC50 (+) represent the IC50 values in which the inhibitor was added to the reaction mixture simultaneously with BFC (coincubation assay) and before the addition of BFC (preincubation assay), respectively. The criteria to determine positive TDI were based on a twofold value of the coefficient of the variation (CV) of the IC50 (–) of ketoconazole.

Herein, we describe rationally-designed, broad-spectrum antifungal agents that are more selective for the target fungal enzyme, CYP51, than related human CYP enzymes such as CYP3A4. Using proprietary methodology, the triazole metal-binding group found in current clinical agents was replaced with novel, less avid metal-binding groups in concert with potency-enhancing molecular scaffold modifications. This process produced a unique series of fungal CYP51-selective inhibitors that included the oral antifungal 7d (VT-1161), now in Phase 2 clinical trials. This series exhibits excellent potency against key yeast and dermatophyte strains. The chemical methodology described is potentially applicable to the design of new and more effective metalloenzyme inhibitor treatments for a broad array of diseases.","The passage that describes the experimental assay used to measure IC50 activity values against the target Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is:

""IC50 values for CYP3A4 enzyme were determined in human hepatocyte microsomes using 150 μM testosterone as substrate (a concentration equal to the Km determined in the same lab). Reactions were analyzed for product using HPLC/MS/MS methods and IC50 values (in μM) were determined by fitting a 4-parameter logistical fit to the dose response data (OpAns, LLC).""

The confidence score for the quality of results produced by this assay is 0.8. This is because the assay uses human hepatocyte microsomes, which is a commonly used and well-established method for measuring CYP3A4 activity. However, the use of a single substrate concentration (150 μM testosterone) and a 4-parameter logistical fit to determine IC50 values may not be the most robust method, which could lead to some uncertainty in the results.

The passage that describes the activity assays for the compounds is:

""Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for standard ATCC isolates were determined under the CLSI guidelines M27-A3 (for yeasts such as C. albicans) and M38-A2 (for dermatophytes such as T. rubrum) and were read at 50% inhibition of fungal growth (Ricerca Biosciences, LLC). IC50 values for CYP3A4 enzyme were determined in human hepatocyte microsomes using 150 μM testosterone as substrate (a concentration equal to the Km determined in the same lab). Reactions were analyzed for product using HPLC/MS/MS methods and IC50 values (in μM) were determined by fitting a 4-parameter logistical fit to the dose response data (OpAns, LLC).""

The confidence score for the quality of results produced by these assays is 0.9. This is because the MIC assays are standardized and widely used, and the CYP3A4 IC50 assays use human hepatocyte microsomes and a robust analytical method (HPLC/MS/MS).",1.8129133566428557
